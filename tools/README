KCNF-CONVERTER

Compile:
1) Go to the kcnf_converter folder and execute:
   cabal build

2) This will compile kcnf-converter and put the resulting 
   executable in the dist/build/kcnf_converter folder.

Run:
1) To convert to kcnf just one file, use the executable in
   the ist/build/kcnf_converter folder as this:

       ./to_kcnf <file>

   This will output the kcnf version of the formula to the 
   standard output.

SY4NCL

Compile:
1) Go to the sy4ncl folder and execute:

    cabal install cmdargs; cabal configure; cabal build

2) This will compile sy4ncl and put the resulting 
   executable in the dist/build/sy4ncl folder.

Run:
1) To generate the bliss graph for just one formula, use the executable as this:
 
       ./sy4ncl -f <file> -t 0

    The "-t 0" param indicates the tool to generate a "global graph"

   This will output three files: the graph of the formula (.bliss file), a mapping from 
   graph nodes to propositional variable (.map file) and some stats about the graph (.stats)


BLISS

Compile:
1) Go to the bliss-0.73 folder and execute:
    make.

Run:
1) To calculate the simmetries for a particular graph you can use the
   bliss executable in the bin folder:
         ./bliss <bliss_file>

   This will output the symmetries information to the standar output.

2) You should append bliss's output to the .stats files so the next step (proc_bliss.py) can retrieve the simmetries.
         ./bliss <bliss_file> >> <stats-file>.stats

PROC_BLISS.py

Run:
  1) Assuming you have a .stats file wit the output from bliss and a map file:
        python proc_bliss.py <stats-file> <map-file>.

  2) The script will generate a .symm file in the same folder where the .stats file is located.
  3) Also the script will output some stats in the form of a csv line containing the following fields:
    "PROBLEM,NODES,EDGES,TOP,BOX,NBOX,LITS,|AUT|,G_GENS,F_GENS,G_TIME,S_TIME,TOTAL_TIME"
  4) The generated .symm file contains the propositional symmetries. The symmetries have the following format:
            l p1 p2
  Each triple corresponds to a "cycle" of the symmetry. The first element of the triple, "l", is the level of to which the cycle applies. Since we are searching for global symmetries "l" will always be 0.
  The next two elements are the numbers of the propositional variables involved in the symmetry.
  So, for example, if you have the following line: 
    0 5 -6,0 -5 6
  This corresponds to the following symmetry:
    (P5 -P6)(-P5 P6)
