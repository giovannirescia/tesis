KCNF-CONVERTER

Compile:
1) Go to the kcnf_converter folder and execute:
   cabal build

2) This will compile kcnf-converter and put the resulting 
   executable in the dist/build/kcnf_converter folder.

Run:
1) To convert to kcnf just one file, use the executable in
   the ist/build/kcnf_converter folder as this:

       ./to_kcnf <file>

   This will output the kcnf version of the formula to the 
   standard output.

SY4NCL

Compile:
1) Go to the sy4ncl folder and execute:

    cabal install cmdargs; cabal configure; cabal build

2) This will compile sy4ncl and put the resulting 
   executable in the dist/build/sy4ncl folder.

Run:
1) To generate the bliss graph for just one formula, use the executable as this:
 
       ./sy4ncl -f <file> -t 0

    The "-t 0" param indicates the tool to generate a "global graph"

   This will output three files: the graph of the formula (.bliss file), a mapping from 
   graph nodes to propositional variable (.map file) and some stats about the graph (.stats)


BLISS

Compile:
1) Go to the bliss-0.73 folder and execute:
    make.

Run:
1) To calculate the simmetries for a particular graph you can use the
   bliss executable in the bin folder:
         ./bliss <bliss_file>

   This will output the symmetries information to the standar output.
