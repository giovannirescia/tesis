KCNF-CONVERTER

Compile:
1) Go to the src folder and execute:
   make
2) This will compile kcnf-converter and put the resulting 
   executable in the bin folder.

Run:
1) To convert to kcnf just one file, use the executable in
   the bin folder as this:

       ./to_kcnf <file>

   This will output the kcnf version of the formula to the 
   standard output.

2) To convert to kcnf the contents of a folder, use the bash
   script, specifying the input folder and the output folder:

       ./to_kcnf.sh <in_folder> <out_folder>

BLISS-GENERATOR

Compile:
1) Go to the src folder and execute:

        make

2) This will compile bliss-generator and put the resulting 
   executable in the bin folder.

3) Compile the bliss tool, then put the resulting executable
   in the bin folder.

Run:
1) To generate the bliss graph for just one formula, use the executable in
   the bin folder as this:

       ./to_bliss <file>

   This will output the graph of the formula to the 
   standard output.

2) To generate graphs for the contents of a folder, use the bash
   script, specifying the input folder and the output folder:

       ./to_bliss.sh <in_folder> <out_folder>

   This will output a .bliss file for each formula in the input folder.

3) To calculate the simmetries for a particular graph you can use the
   bliss executable in the bin folder:
         ./bliss <bliss_file>

   This will output the symmetries information to the standar output.

4) To calculate the simmetries for a set of .bliss files use the bash
   script, specifying the folder where all the .bliss files are and the
   output folder:
        
        ./exec_bliss.sh <in_folder> <out_folder>

   For each input graph the script will generate .bliss file with the same
   graph plus all the symmetries information. 
   With the contents of the output folder you can execute the script 
   src/bliss_proccess.py to generate the .symm files and extract statistics.
   The .symm files contain the symmetries translated to literals of the original
   formula.


SCRIPTS

1)kcnf-to-bliss.sh

   This scripts concentrate the whole proccess of translating a formula 
   to kcnf, generate the bliss graphs, calculate the symmetries and 
   generate the symmetries file for htab.

   The script can be executed with the following options:
     Folder Options:
          -d: source folder
          -o: output folder
     Process Options: 
          no options: execute the whole process
          -b: execute the process: to bliss -> execute bliss -> get stats
          -e: execute the process: execute bliss -> get stats
          -s: execute the process: get stats
 
2)pack_benchmark.sh
   Given a folder of kcnf formulas and a folder of .symm files, generates
   a tar file containing the kcnf formula and the corresponding .symm file.
